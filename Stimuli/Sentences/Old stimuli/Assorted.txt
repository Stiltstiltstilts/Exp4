The man was very hungry after the meeting so had lunch early
The dog that barked is very big and very friendly but doesnâ€™t like cats
The boy who had a birthday called his best friend for a chat
The desk was new but dusty and covered with old books
The fish was caught by the girl on the boat on a Friday
The car that was new had just been cleaned by the old lady
The man who was short gave his wife some red candles for her birthday
The cat chased the bird but it flew away into the sunset
The bike that was yellow and shiny belonged to the boy with the hat
The dessert was served with custard and fruit then there was coffee
The girl and the boy that owned the horse had mud on their clothes
The piano was well played by the old lady but it was not in tune
The wine that was fancy was kept in the cellar for ten years and five months
The girl kicked the ball into the window but it did not break
The colour of the house was brighter than the men who travelled expected
The concert started later than what the lady told the traveler
The apples that the couple bought at the market were red
The job that was given was different to what she expected
The boss was happy to see the work that the two girls had done
The girl on the school trip saw a frog and later she saw a mouse
The ring that was sadly lost was found by the fat and happy priest
The hat that was worn by the boy with a jacket was too small for the man
The box was made from wood and was full of things that shined
The cup was made from green plastic and was filled with juice
The book that the lady with a tattoo had written was her best book yet
